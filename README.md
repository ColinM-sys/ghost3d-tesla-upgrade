# Tesla Model 3 CAN Bus Toolkit

Open-source tools for reading, writing, and analyzing CAN bus data on Tesla Model 3/Y vehicles. Includes drive mode modification (ghost mode), live dashboards, and drive recording.

## Features

- **CAN Read** — Capture and decode 300+ CAN signals in real-time
- **CAN Write** — Send commands to the vehicle (horn, lights, drive mode)
- **Ghost Mode** — Change drive mode (Chill/Standard/Performance) via CAN bus injection
- **Live Dashboard** — Web-based real-time vehicle data display
- **Drive Recording** — Log all CAN traffic during drives for offline analysis
- **Signal Analysis** — Timeline view of pedal position, steering angle, speed, power

## Ghost Mode (Drive Mode Modification)

Ghost mode works by injecting CAN frames that override the touchscreen's drive mode setting. The motor controller accepts the CAN bus value regardless of what the UI displays.

### How It Works

The Tesla touchscreen sends `UI_pedalMap` on CAN ID `0x334` to set the drive mode:

| Value | Mode | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Chill | Reduced acceleration |
| 1 | Standard | Normal acceleration |
| 2 | Performance | Maximum acceleration |

Ghost mode continuously sends frames with `UI_pedalMap = 2` (Performance) at 50ms intervals, overriding whatever the touchscreen is set to. The motor controller responds to whichever frame arrives most recently.

### Frame Format

```
CAN ID: 0x334
Real frame: BF 3F 14 80 FC 07 XX XX  (Standard mode)
Ghost frame: DF 3F 14 80 FC 07 XX XX  (Performance mode)
                                ^^ ^^ counter/checksum bytes
```

Byte 0 bits 5-6 control the pedal map:
- `BF` (10**11**1111) = Standard (01)
- `DF` (11**01**1111) = Performance (10)
- `9F` (10**01**1111) = Chill (00)

### Usage

```bash
# Activate Performance mode for 60 seconds
python tools/pedalmap_v2.py

# Interactive mode - choose drive mode
python tools/can_write_test.py -p COM5
```

### Important Notes

- Ghost mode only lasts while the script is running
- Stopping the script immediately reverts to the touchscreen setting
- The car does NOT display the change on screen — the UI still shows your original setting
- Tested on 2019 Model 3 SR+ (RWD, Intel MCU)

## CAN Write Capabilities

Successfully tested write commands:

| Command | CAN ID | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Horn honk | 0x273 | Confirmed working |
| Drive mode change | 0x334 | Confirmed working |
| Dome light | 0x273 | Untested |
| Frunk open | 0x273 | Untested |

Write method uses ELM327-standard `ATSH` (set header) + send data bytes.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Tesla Model 3 or Model Y** (2018-2023)
- **OBDLink MX+** (or compatible STN2120/ELM327 Bluetooth OBD2 adapter with CAN write support)
- **CAN bus tap** — rear seat splice to vehicle CAN bus
- **Laptop** with Bluetooth and Python 3.10+

## Supported Signals (300+)

| Signal | CAN ID | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Accelerator Pedal | 0x118 | Pedal position 0-100% |
| Brake Pedal State | 0x118 | Brake ON/OFF |
| Steering Angle | 0x129 | Wheel angle in degrees |
| Steering Speed | 0x129 | Rate of steering input |
| Vehicle Speed | 0x318 | Speed from ESP module |
| Battery SOC | 0x132 | State of charge % |
| Pack Voltage | 0x252 | HV battery voltage |
| Pack Current | 0x292 | Battery current flow |
| Wheel Speeds | 0x388-0x38B | Individual wheel speeds (FL, FR, RL, RR) |
| Drive Mode | 0x334 | Chill / Standard / Performance |
| Steering Mode | 0x293 | Comfort / Standard / Sport |
| Door States | 0x2E1, 0x2E3 | Open/Closed per door |
| Ambient Temp | 0x3F5 | Outside temperature |
| Motor Temps | 0x376 | Inverter and stator temps |
| Battery Temps | 0x201 | Pack temp min/max |
| Power | 0x261 | Electrical power draw |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColinM-sys/tesla-can-toolkit.git
cd tesla-can-toolkit
pip install pyserial python-can
```

### 2. Connect

Pair OBDLink MX+ via Bluetooth (PIN: `1234`), then:

```bash
python tools/scan_ports.py        # Find adapter
python tools/test_connection.py   # Verify connection
```

### 3. Read

```bash
# Capture CAN data
python tools/can_capture.py --port COM5 --duration 30

# Decode capture
python tools/can_decode.py captures/can_capture_*.log
```

### 4. Live Dashboard

```bash
python tools/drive_recorder.py --port COM5
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### 5. Write (Ghost Mode)

```bash
# Interactive write menu (horn, lights, drive mode)
python tools/can_write_test.py --port COM5

# Performance mode for 60 seconds
python tools/pedalmap_v2.py
```

### 6. Analyze Drive

```bash
python tools/analyze_drive.py captures/drive_*.log
```

## How It Works

```
Tesla CAN Bus ──► CAN Splice ──► OBDLink MX+ ──► Bluetooth ──► Laptop
                  (rear seat)    (STN2255 chip)                (Python)

Read:  STMA command ──► passive listen ──► decode with DBC
Write: ATSH + data  ──► inject frame  ──► car responds
```

## Known Issues

- **STMA buffer overflow**: Bluetooth can't keep up with full CAN traffic. Auto-restart handles this.
- **Signal calibration**: Some decoded values have offset errors. DBC file is community-maintained.
- **Bluetooth range**: ~30 feet max. Keep laptop near the adapter.
- **Ghost mode counter**: The last 2 bytes of the 0x334 frame are counter/checksum. Current implementation rotates values — a proper CRC implementation would be more reliable.

## Tested Hardware

| Component | Model | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Vehicle | 2019 Tesla Model 3 SR+ | RWD, Intel MCU, HW2.5/3 |
| Adapter | OBDLink MX+ r3.1 | STN2255 v5.6.19, Bluetooth |
| CAN tap | Rear seat splice | Direct CAN bus, not OBD2 port |
